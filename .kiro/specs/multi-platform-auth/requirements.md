## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a wine enthusiast, I want to access the app's main page with a camera button, so that I can quickly start the wine recognition process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the main page, THE Camera_Interface SHALL display a prominent camera button
2. WHEN a user clicks the camera button, THE Camera_Interface SHALL activate the device camera with appropriate permissions
3. THE Camera_Interface SHALL provide a clear viewfinder for wine label photography
4. WHEN camera activation fails, THE Camera_Interface SHALL display an error message with troubleshooting guidance
5. THE Camera_Interface SHALL support both mobile and desktop camera access

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to photograph a wine label and get instant recognition results, so that I can learn about the wine and connect with others drinking the same wine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user captures a photo of a wine label, THE Wine_Recognition_System SHALL process the image to identify the wine
2. WHEN wine recognition is successful, THE Wine_Recognition_System SHALL display wine information including name, vintage, region, and tasting notes
3. WHEN wine information is displayed, THE Wine_Recognition_System SHALL show the number of other users currently drinking the same wine
4. THE Wine_Recognition_System SHALL provide a confidence score for the recognition result
5. IF wine recognition fails, THEN THE Wine_Recognition_System SHALL allow manual wine selection from the Wine_Database

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a wine lover, I want to join a video chat room with others drinking the same wine, so that I can share tasting experiences and connect with fellow enthusiasts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN wine recognition is completed, THE Matching_System SHALL create or join a Wine_Room specific to that wine
2. WHEN entering a Wine_Room, THE Matching_System SHALL display current participants and their profiles
3. THE Wine_Room SHALL support real-time video and audio communication using LiveKit
4. WHILE in a Wine_Room, THE Matching_System SHALL allow users to share tasting notes and ratings
5. WHEN a user leaves the Wine_Room, THE Matching_System SHALL update the participant count for other users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose from multiple login options (Google, X/Twitter, LINE), so that I can use my preferred social platform for authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the login page, THE Login_Interface SHALL display three distinct login options for Google, X/Twitter, and LINE
2. WHEN a user clicks on any login provider button, THE Authentication_System SHALL initiate the appropriate OAuth_Flow for that provider
3. WHEN a user successfully authenticates with any provider, THE Authentication_System SHALL redirect them to the main application
4. WHERE a user has previously registered with one provider, THE Authentication_System SHALL allow them to link additional providers to the same account
5. IF an authentication attempt fails, THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL display a clear error message and allow retry

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register using any of the supported social platforms, so that I can quickly create an account and start using wine recognition features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user completes OAuth authentication with any provider, THE Authentication_System SHALL extract basic profile information from the provider
2. WHEN profile information is successfully retrieved, THE Authentication_System SHALL prompt the user to select their main language
3. WHEN a user selects their main language, THE Authentication_System SHALL create a new User_Profile with the provider information and language preference
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL store the provider-specific user ID, email, name, and profile image URL
5. WHERE a user's email already exists from another provider, THE Authentication_System SHALL offer to link the accounts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the wine recognition to be accurate and fast, so that I can quickly join relevant wine discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Wine_Recognition_System SHALL process wine label images within 5 seconds
2. THE Wine_Recognition_System SHALL achieve at least 85% accuracy for common wine labels
3. WHEN multiple wines are detected in an image, THE Wine_Recognition_System SHALL allow the user to select the intended wine
4. THE Wine_Recognition_System SHALL continuously learn from user corrections to improve accuracy
5. WHERE network connectivity is poor, THE Wine_Recognition_System SHALL provide offline recognition for popular wines

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure handling of OAuth credentials and user data, so that user privacy and security are maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL store OAuth credentials securely using environment variables
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL never store user passwords or OAuth access tokens in the database
3. WHEN handling user data from providers, THE Authentication_System SHALL only collect necessary information (ID, email, name, profile image)
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL implement proper error handling for OAuth failures
5. WHERE OAuth tokens expire, THE Authentication_System SHALL handle refresh flows appropriately
